# Challenges
1. There are at least six domain-specific languages used in [the little system I 
cobbled together](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters) to write and 
publish this book. What are they?

2. Get a “Hello, world!” program written and running in Java. Set up whatever 
makefiles or IDE projects you need to get it working. If you have a debugger, get 
comfortable with it and step through your program as it runs.

3. Do the same thing for C. To get some practice with pointers, define a doubly 
linked list of heap-allocated strings. Write functions to insert, find, and delete 
items from it. Test them.

# Answers/Implementations
## 1: The 6 domain-specific languages
To start with I think `make` would count. There are markdown files on the there so
`md` would count. There's `css` and `html` (though I'm not sure you can call those
little.) If we're counting `css`, then I'll also count `scss`. That gets me to 5.
Inside the .iml files for IntelliJ, there's actually `xml`. That's 6!

## 2: Hello World in Java
This will be in the /hello_world_java directory.

## 3: C doubly linked lists
This will be in the /doubly_linked_list_c directory.
